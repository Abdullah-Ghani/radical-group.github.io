<p><em>The Research in Advanced Distributed Cyberinfrastructure and Applications Laboratory</em>
(RADICAL) works at the triple point of Computing, Computation &amp; Data-enabled Science 
and Cyberinfrastructure Research &amp; Development. See our Projects Pages for some 
exciting examples of the projects we are working on.</p>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>The development of high-performance and distributed cyberinfrastructure – tools, 
middleware and frameworks – to support computational science has historically 
been characterized by local and point solutions; tools are often unsustainable 
whilst many solutions are redundant. This state-of-practice points to missing 
abstractions, design principles and systems engineering concepts for high-performance 
distributed cyberinfrastructure. The RADICAL (Research in Advanced Distributed 
Cyberinfrastructure and Applications Laboratory) team addresses these shortcomings 
by contributing to the science-of-cyberinfrastructure. A science-of-cyberinfrastructure 
provides a pathway to translate theoretical advances and conceptual abstractions 
into cyberinfrastructure developed as an engineered system which provides the 
required balance of functionality, performance and usability.</p>

<h3 id="software-development">Software Development</h3>
<p>We develop <em>RADICAL-SAGA</em> (in python) and <em>SAGA-based Pilot-Job (RADICAL-Pilot/BigJob)</em> 
amongst other RADICAL Cybertools — a repertoire of  tools and capabilities that 
enable the scalable, extensible and interoperable utilization of regional, 
national and international production distributed cyberinfrastructure.  RADICAL 
members lead the SAGA project – a global distributed computing standard, used 
by many applications, tool-developers and production distributed computing 
infrastructures.</p>
