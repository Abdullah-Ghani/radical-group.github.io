I"]<p>This collaborative project aims to develop a next-generation autonomous manufacturing process for pharmaceutical production that integrates product and process informatics with knowledge management. The integration of process data, process models, and information management tools will enable adaptive adjustment to the operating conditions to compensate for variability in raw materials and changing product needs. We want to develop and autonomous and de-centralized integrated platform to dynamically adapt and improve process operations based on historic data and data acquired during runtime.</p>
