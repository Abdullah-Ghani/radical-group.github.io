I"P<p>I am Assistant Research Professor at the department of <a href="https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>, Rutgers University. Before moving to Rutgers, I was the Chair of the <a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_Federated_Cloud">EGI Federated Cloud</a> and Senior Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford e-Research Centre (OeRC)</a>, University of Oxford, UK. My research interests primarily concern bridging the gap between distributed and high performance computing, designing middleware for scientific cyberinfrastructures, and supporting domain-specific scientific workflows. I collaborate with several domain scientists to enable research in biological sciences, earth sciences, climate sciences and particle physics. For my research, I use production infrastructures like <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/olcf-resources/">OLCF</a>, <a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/">NCSA</a>, <a href="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/resources-overview">NCAR</a> and <a href="https://www.xsede.org/">XSEDE</a>, performing large-scale experiments on among the <a href="https://www.top500.org/">biggest “supercomputers”</a> currently available. Highly motivated students with similar research interests and looking for joining a Master or PhD program are always welcome to get in contact.</p>
