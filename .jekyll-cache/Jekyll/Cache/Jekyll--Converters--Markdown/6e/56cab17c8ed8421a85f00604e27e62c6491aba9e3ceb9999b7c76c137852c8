I"±<p>This project elaborates a plan to construct the Campus Compute Cooperative (CCC), a shared cyberinfrastructure as well as a social fabric. CCC will: (i) connect and federate campus physical infrastructures; (ii) use market-based mechanisms for resource allocation and quality of service to avoid the ‚Äútragedy of the commons‚Äù; (iii) leverage <a href="https://www.incommon.org/">InCommon</a> and local identity management systems to provide federated authentication and authorization to resources; (iv) facilitate secure data and storage sharing between institutions and research labs; (v) offer ‚Äúcloud bursting‚Äù to member institutions; and, (vi) provide paid-for, differentiated quality of service. In this way, CCC will both accelerate discovery and provide a research cyberinfrastructure with better cost/benefit by rationally and securely sharing the limited computational and human resources available for research enterprise.</p>
