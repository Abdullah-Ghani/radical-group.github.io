I"æ<p>Material analysis is critical to enable the production of safe and high-quality goods. Today companies use cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone methods to analyze materials which require expensive analytical laboratories. We develop a software application to enable cutting-edge material analysis, producing accurate and near real-time readings. We use machine learning  algorithms and high performance computing to process data gathered from hand-held infrared 
sensors.</p>
