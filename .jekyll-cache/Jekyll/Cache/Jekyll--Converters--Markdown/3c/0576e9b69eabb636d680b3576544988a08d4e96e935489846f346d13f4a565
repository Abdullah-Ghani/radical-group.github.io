I"Å<p>The overall objective of this project is to develop a data-enabled computational 
framework for the efficient design and improved operation of pharmaceutical 
processes using advances in cyberinfrastructure (CI). This work targeted the following: 
1) CI enabled multi-scale process modeling of an integrated production 
line; and 2) model integration within a pilot-plant experimental facility and 
real-time refinement of the multi-scale model.</p>
