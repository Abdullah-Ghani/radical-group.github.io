I"P<p>I am a Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. Concentration Area: Computer Engineering. My motivation is toward the software aspect of my career, passionate about being able to apply AI (machine learning, computer vision) to robotics and doing software engineering in general. However, I have a strong background on hardware as well, thanks to my undergrad studies in Electronics Engineering at Simón Bolívar University in Caracas, Venezuela. I speak English, Spanish and Arabic.</p>
