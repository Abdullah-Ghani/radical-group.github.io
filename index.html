<p align="justify">The Research in Advanced Distributed Cyberinfrastructure and Applications Laboratory (RADICAL) works at the triple point of Computing, Computation & Data-enabled Science and Cyberinfrastructure Research & Development. See our Projects Pages for some exciting examples of the projects we are working on.</p>

<p align="justify">The development of high-performance and distributed cyberinfrastructure – tools, middleware and frameworks – to support computational science has historically been characterized by local and point solutions; tools are often unsustainable whilst many solutions are redundant. This state-of-practice points to missing abstractions, design principles and systems engineering concepts for high-performance distributed cyberinfrastructure. The RADICAL (Research in Advanced Distributed Cyberinfrastructure and Applications Laboratory) team addresses these shortcomings by contributing to the science-of-cyberinfrastructure. A science-of-cyberinfrastructure provides a pathway to translate theoretical advances and conceptual abstractions into cyberinfrastructure developed as an engineered system which provides the required balance of functionality, performance and usability.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition to cyberinfrastructure research and development, RADICAL is engaged in using advanced cyberinfrastructure to address a diverse set of challenging science & engineering problems at scale, ranging from biomolecular sciences to polar science and high-energy physics. The RADICAL team is also engaged in understanding fundamental and advanced computing concepts to enable advances in scientific computing at scale.</p>

<p align="justify">We develop RADICAL-SAGA (in python) and SAGA-based Pilot-Job (RADICAL-Pilot/BigJob) amongst other RADICAL Cybertools — a repertoire of  tools and capabilities that enable the scalable, extensible and interoperable utilization of regional, national and international production distributed cyberinfrastructure.  RADICAL members lead the SAGA project – a global distributed computing standard, used by many applications, tool-developers and production distributed computing infrastructures.</p>
