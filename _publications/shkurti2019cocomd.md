abstract: "CoCo (“Complementary Coordinates”) is a method for ensemble enrichment based on 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that was developed originally for the 
investigation of NMR data. Here we investigate the potential of the CoCo method,
in combination with molecular dynamics simulations (CoCo-MD), to be used more
generally for the enhanced sampling of conformational space. Using the alanine
penta-peptide as a model system, we find that an iterative workflow, 
interleaving short multiple-walker MD simulations with long-range jumps through
conformational space informed by CoCo analysis, can increase the rate of sampling
of conformational space up to ten times for the same computational effort (total
number of MD timesteps). Combined with the reservoir-REMD method, free energies
can be readily calculated. An alternative, approximate but fast and practically 
useful, alternative approach to unbiasing CoCo-MD generated data is also 
described. Applied to cyclosporine A, we can achieve far greater conformational
sampling than has been reported previously, using a fraction of the computational
resource. Simulations of the maltose binding protein, begun from the ‘open’
state, effectively sample the ‘closed’ conformation associated with ligand
binding. The PCA-based approach means that optimal collective variables to
enhance sampling need not be defined in advance by the user, but are identified
automatically and are adaptive, responding to the characteristics of the
developing ensemble. In addition the approach does not require any adaptations 
to the associated MD code, and is compatible with any conventional MDg."
