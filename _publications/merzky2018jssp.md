abstract: "High-performance computing systems have historically been designed to support
applications comprised of mostly monolithic, singlejob workloads. Pilot systems
decouple workload specification, resource selection, and task execution via job
placeholders and late-binding. Pilot systems help to satisfy the resource
requirements of workloads comprised of multiple tasks. RADICAL-Pilot (RP) is
a modular and extensible Python-based pilot system. In this paper we describe
RP’s design, architecture and implementation, and characterize its performance.
RP is capable of spawning more than 100 tasks/second and the steady-state
execution of up to 16K concurrent tasks. RP can be used stand-alone, as well as
integrated with other application-level tools as a runtime system."
