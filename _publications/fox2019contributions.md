abstract: "Our project is at the interface of Big Data and HPC - High-Performance 
Big Data computing and this paper describes a collaboration between 7 collaborating 
Universities at Arizona State, Indiana (lead), Kansas, Rutgers, Stony Brook, 
Virginia Tech, and Utah. It addresses the intersection of High-performance and 
Big Data computing with several different application areas or communities 
driving the requirements for software systems and algorithms. We describe the 
base architecture, including the HPC-ABDS, High-Performance Computing enhanced 
Apache Big Data Stack, and an application use case study identifying key features 
that determine software and algorithm requirements. We summarize middleware 
including Harp-DAAL collective communication layer, Twister2 Big Data toolkit, 
and pilot jobs. Then we present the SPIDAL Scalable Parallel Interoperable Data 
Analytics Library and our work for it in core machine- learning, image processing 
and the application communities, Network science, Polar Science, Biomolecular 
Simulations, Pathology, and Spatial systems. We describe basic algorithms and 
their integration in end-to-end use cases."
