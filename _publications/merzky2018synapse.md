## Abstract:

We introduce Synapse motivated by the needs to emulate workload execution
characteristics on high-performance and distributed heterogeneous resources.
Synapse has a platform independent application profiler, and the ability to
emulate profiled workloads on a variety of resources. Synapse is used as a proxy
application (or "representative application") for real workloads, with the added
advantage that it can be tuned in different ways and at arbitrary levels of
granularity in ways that are simply not possible using real applications.
Experiments show that automated profiling using Synapse represents application
characteristics with high fidelity. Emulation using Synapse can reproduce the
application behaviour in the original runtime environment, as well as
reproducing properties when used in a different run-time environments.
