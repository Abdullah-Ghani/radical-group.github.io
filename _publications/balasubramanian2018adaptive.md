abstract: "Recent advances in both theory and methods have created opportunities to
simulate biomolecular processes more efficiently using adaptive ensemble
simulations. Ensemble-based simulations are used widely to compute a number of
individual simulation trajectories and analyze statistics across them. Adaptive
ensemble simulations offer a further level of sophistication and flexibility by
enabling high-level algorithms to control simulations-based on intermediate
results. Novel high-level algorithms require sophisticated approaches to utilize
the intermediate data during runtime. Thus, there is a need for scalable
software systems to support adaptive ensemble-based applications. We describe
three different types of adaptations and propose four operations necessary to
support these adaptations. We identify and address the challenges of
expressibility, instantiation and implementation of the four operations. We
enhance the Ensemble Toolkit -- an ensemble execution system -- with
abstractions to support these operations. We characterize the overhead of
supporting adaptive capabilties in the toolkit at production scale. We
implement two high-level adaptive algorithms: expanded ensemble and Markov
state modeling. We highlight scientific advantages enabled by the novel
capabilities of our approach and implementation on three distinct platforms."
