This is a collaborative project that studies a wide range of cancer drugs and candidate ligands. The goal is to support personalized clinical decision-making based on genome sequencing and drug discovery. We use ensemble-based, high-performance computing methods, running automated workflows at unprecedented scales. We developed the [High-Throughput Binding Affinity Calculator (HTBAC)](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/htbac), integrating of the [Binding Affinity Calculator (BAC)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci8000937), developed by the [Centre for Computational Science](http://ccs.chem.ucl.ac.uk/) at UCL, with [RADICAL-Cybertools](https://radical-cybertools.github.io/), developed by the RADICAL Laboratory at Rutgers University. HTBAC enables rapid, accurate, scalable, reliable and adaptive free energy-based binding affinity calculations, separating the definition of a free energy protocols from its distributed execution. Adaptivity allows users to change the course of execution during runtime, favoring interesting simulations and drug candidates. Co-PIs on the project are Peter Coveney (UCL) and Shantenu Jha (Rutgers).
