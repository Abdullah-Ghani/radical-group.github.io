The Polar Research Coordination Network connects the Polar Science, Data and High-Performance and Distributed Computing (HPDC) communities to enable deeper penetration of computing methods and cyberinfrastructure into the polar sciences. The potential for global impact with huge socio-economic costs makes understanding polar climate change, and the links between polar and global systems, and urgent priority. Despite the data- and compute-intensive scientific needs of modern polar science, use of HPDC is currently limited. Bringing these communities together in a sustained, multi-dimensional engagement has the potential to inform HPDC development and transform polar science research.
