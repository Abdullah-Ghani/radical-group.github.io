The Polar Research Coordination Network aims to connect the Polar Science, Data
and High-Performance and Distributed Computing (HPDC) communities to enable
deeper penetration of computing methods and cyberinfrastructure into the polar
sciences.  The potential for global impact with huge socio-economic costs makes
understanding polar climate change, and the links between polar and global
systems, and urgent priority. Despite the data- and compute-intensive scientific
needs of modern polar science, use of HPDC is currently limited. Bringing these
communities together in a sustained, multi-dimensional engagement has the
potential to inform HPDC development and transform polar science research.
