title: "Polar Computing RCN"
collection: projects
permalink: /projects/polar-computing
abstract: "Led by the RADICAL Lab the NSF funded Polar Computing Research Coordination
Network was tasked with analyzing opportunities and barriers in the uptake of
high-performance & distributed computing for polar science. Specifically the
charge of the RCN was to: (i) Identify opportunities for and barriers to greater
uptake of High-Performance and Distributed Cyberinfrastructure by polar
sciences, (ii) How to ensure that plans and design for new and existing
NSF-funded cyberinfrastructure efforts are cognizant of the needs of the Polar
Science community, and (iii) Understand how best to educate a new generation of
polar scientists in the skills needed to realize the opportunities and potential
of HPDC."

The Polar Research Coordination Network aims to connect the Polar Science, Data
and High-Performance and Distributed Computing (HPDC) communities to enable
deeper penetration of computing methods and cyberinfrastructure into the polar
sciences.  The potential for global impact with huge socio-economic costs makes
understanding polar climate change, and the links between polar and global
systems, and urgent priority. Despite the data- and compute-intensive scientific
needs of modern polar science, use of HPDC is currently limited. Bringing these
communities together in a sustained, multi-dimensional engagement has the
potential to inform HPDC development and transform polar science research.
