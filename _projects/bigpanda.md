Achieving operational goals is an important step towards enabling the convergence of HPC and HTC paradigms for a range of application types and communities. In meeting these goals, we develop both practical experience as well conceptual insight into some of the challenges which will ultimately help ASCR devise a working plan of engagement and support with science applications from other DOE offices. These include but are not limited to supporting diverse use-cases and requirements, sharing workloads across HTC and HPC resources, and investigating the operational implications of running traditional HTC workloads on HPC resources.
