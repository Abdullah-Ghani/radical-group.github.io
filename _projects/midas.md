Middleware for Data-Intensive Analytics and Science (MIDAS) will support new 
programming and execution models for data-intensive analysis in a wide range of 
science and engineering applications.

The long term science objective of MIDAS is to provide a scalable runtime system 
and appropriate resource management abstractions enabling [SPIDAL](http://www.spidal.org) 
libraries. MIDAS will be responsible for the underlying resource management 
middleware and heterogeneous infrastructure access layer which will support 
streaming based applications to also exploit SPIDAL libraries to work efficiently 
across application types, over a range of resources.
