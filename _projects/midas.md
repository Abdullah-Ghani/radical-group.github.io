Middleware for Data-Intensive Analytics and Science (MIDAS) supports new programming and execution models for data-intensive analysis in a wide range of science and engineering applications. MIDAS provides a scalable runtime system and appropriate resource management abstractions enabling <a href="http://www.spidal.org">SPIDAL</a> libraries. In addition, MIDAS provides the underlying resource management middleware and heterogeneous infrastructure access layer to support streaming-based applications on High Performance Computing resources.
