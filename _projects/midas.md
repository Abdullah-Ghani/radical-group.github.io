Middleware for Data-Intensive Analytics and Science (MIDAS) supports new 
programming and execution models for data-intensive analysis in a wide range of 
science and engineering applications. MIDAS provides a scalable runtime system and 
appropriate resource management abstractions enabling [SPIDAL](http://www.spidal.org) 
libraries. In addition, MIDAS provides the underlying resource management 
middleware and heterogeneous infrastructure access layer to support 
streaming-based applications on High Performance Computing resources.
