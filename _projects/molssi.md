The Molecular Sciences Software Institute serves as a nexus for science,
education, and cooperation serving the worldwide community of computational
molecular scientists – a broad field including of biomolecular simulation,
quantum chemistry, and materials science. The Institute is responsible for
significant advances in software infrastructure, education, standards, and
best-practices that are needed to enable the molecular science community to
open new windows on the next generation of scientific Grand Challenges,
ranging from the simulation of intrinsically disordered proteins associated
with a range of diseases to the design of new catalysts vital to the global
chemical industry and climate change. The RADICAL Lab is playing a leading
role in the software engineering activities and middleware design and
development upon which MolSSI is developing its capabilities.
