distributed computing exemplar project to demonstrate and investigate new ways
of federating campus computing capabilities"

The idea of sharing resources between institutions is not new and has been
relatively successful in a few instances and largely unsuccessful in many
cases. This project  elaborates a plan to construct the Campus Compute
Cooperative (CCC), a shared cyberinfrastructure as well as a social fabric; both
computational resources and support staff expertise will be pooled and
shared. The CCC will: i) connect and federate campus physical infrastructures;
ii) use market-based mechanisms for resource allocation and quality of service
to avoid the tragedy of the commons; iii) leverage InCommon and local identity
management systems to provide integrated cross-institution authentication and
access control of resources; iv) facilitate secure data and storage sharing
between institutions and research labs; v) offer "cloud bursting" to member
institutions; and, vi) provide paid-for, differentiated quality of service.

The impact of on-demand, pay-per-use (cloud) resources on society has been
huge. Making the most of limited resources is critical to the success of the
nation's research enterprise. By rationally and securely sharing the limited
computational and human resources available for research the CCC will both
accelerate discovery and provide a research cyberinfrastructure with better
cost/benefit.
