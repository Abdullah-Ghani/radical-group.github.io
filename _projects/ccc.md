abstract: "The Campus Compute Cooperative (CCC) Project is a high-risk, novel,
distributed computing exemplar project to demonstrate and investigate new ways
of federating campus computing capabilities."

This project elaborates a plan to construct the Campus Compute Cooperative
(CCC), a shared cyberinfrastructure as well as a social fabric. CCC will: (i)
connect and federate campus physical infrastructures; (ii) use market-based
mechanisms for resource allocation and quality of service to avoid the
"tragedy of the commons"; (iii) leverage [InCommon](https://www.incommon.org/)
and local identity management systems to provide federated authentication and
authorization to resources; (iv) facilitate secure data and storage sharing
between institutions and research labs; (v) offer "cloud bursting" to member
institutions; and, (vi) provide paid-for, differentiated quality of service.
In this way, CCC will both accelerate discovery and provide a research
cyberinfrastructure with better cost/benefit by rationally and securely
sharing the limited computational and human resources available for research
enterprise.
