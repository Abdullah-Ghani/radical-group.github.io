Material analysis is critical to enable the production of safe and quality goods 
and today companies use cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone methods to 
analyze materials using expensive analytical laboratories. 

Our objective is to provide a cutting-edge material analysis application which 
produces accurate, and near real-time readings. We use machine learning 
(ML) algorithms leveraging HPC to process data gathered from handheld infrared 
sensors.
