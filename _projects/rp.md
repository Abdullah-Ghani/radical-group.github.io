RADICAL-Pilot (RP) is a flexible Pilot System that provides a simple and an
scalable approach for executing many concurrent simulations and their data
requirements on clusters, grids, and clouds.  RP is written in Python and is
easily deployable into user space. It allows user-level control of Pilots and
supports a wide range of application types. It is built on top of The Simple API
for Grid Applications (RADICAL-SAGA), a high-level, easy-to-use API for
accessing distributed resources. RP thus works on a variety of backends such as
PBS, SGE, Amazon EC2, etc.

### RADICAL-Pilot is:

  **Scalable:** Capable of scheduling O(10k) tasks and marshalling O(100k)
  distributed cores, RADICAL-Pilot offers its users a lightweight API capable of
  handling a variety of workloads.

  **Versatile:** The skyâ€™s the limit as far as applications are concerned.
  With use cases ranging from molecular dynamics to astrophysics, many projects
  can benefit from the use of RADICAL-Pilot.

  **Easy-to-use:** RADICAL-Pilot allows its users to submit tasks to a variety
  of HPC machines using only a single, straightforward API.

  **Fast:** Submit all your tasks via only one job using RADICAL-Pilot,
  avoiding unnecessary batch scheduling times and significantly reducing
  time-to-completion.

  
### Who is using RADICAL-Pilot?
  
RP is being used by Chemistry researchers to support large-scale and
multidimensional replica exchange simulations on supercomputers.

Researchers at UCL London are using RP to advance understanding of
HIV drug resistance and make personalized treatment possible.

RP supports multi-physics and coupled simulations, such as hybrid CFD-MD
simulations to understand Couette Flow, as well as PBM-DEM simulations for
Cybermanufacturing.
