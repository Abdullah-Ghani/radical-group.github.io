abstract: "RADICAL-Pilot (RP) is a flexible Pilot System that provides a simple
and scalable approach for executing many concurrent simulations clusters and
grids. RP is written in Python and is deployable into user space. It allows
user-level control of HPC resources and supports a wide range of application
types. It is built on top of the *Simple API for Grid Applications"
(RADICAL-SAGA), a high-level, easy-to-use API for accessing distributed
resources. RP thus works on a variety of backends such as PBS, LSF, Slurm etc."

### RADICAL-Pilot is:

  **Scalable:** Capable of scheduling O(10k) tasks and marshalling O(100k)
  distributed cores, RADICAL-Pilot offers its users a lightweight API capable of
  handling a variety of workloads.

  **Versatile:** The skyâ€™s the limit as far as applications are concerned.
  With use cases ranging from molecular dynamics to astrophysics, many projects
  can benefit from using RADICAL-Pilot.

  **Easy-to-use:** RADICAL-Pilot allows its users to submit tasks to a variety
  of HPC machines using only a single, straightforward API.  It is deployed in
  user space, and does not system support nor additional permissions.

  **Fast:** Submit all your tasks via only one job using RADICAL-Pilot,
  avoiding unnecessary batch scheduling times and significantly reducing
  time-to-completion.

  
### Who is using RADICAL-Pilot?
  
RP is being used by Chemistry researchers to support large-scale and
multidimensional replica exchange simulations on supercomputers.

Researchers at UCL London are using RP to advance understanding of
HIV drug resistance and make personalized treatment possible.

RP supports multi-physics and coupled simulations, such as hybrid CFD-MD
simulations to understand Couette Flow, as well as PBM-DEM simulations for
Cybermanufacturing.
