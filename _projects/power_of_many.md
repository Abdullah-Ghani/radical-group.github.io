The study of hazards and renewable energy are paramount for the development and
sustainability of society. Similarly, the emergence of new climatic patterns
pose new challenges for future societal planning. Geospatial data are being
generated at unprecedented rate exceeding our analysis capabilities and leading
towards a data-rich but knowledge-poor environment. The use of advanced
computing tools and techniques are playing an increasingly important role in
contributing to solutions to problems of societal importance. This project will
create specialized computational tools that will enhance the ability of
scientists to effectively and efficiently study natural hazards and renewable
energy. The use of these tools will support novel methods and the use of
powerful computing resources in ways that are not currently possible.

Many scientific applications in the field of Earth Sciences are increasingly
reliant on “ensemble-based” methods to make scientific progress. This is true
for applications that are both net producers of data, as well as aggregate
consumers of data. In response to the growing importance and pervasiveness of
ensemble-based applications and analysis, and to address the challenges of
scale, simplicity and flexibility, we propose the Ensemble Toolkit for Earth
Sciences. The Ensemble Toolkit will provide an important addition to the set
of capabilities and tools that will enable the Earth Science community to use
high-performance computing resources more efficiently, effectively and in an
extensible fashion. This project represents the co-design of Ensemble Toolkit
for Earth Sciences and is a collective effort of an interdisciplinary team of
cyber-infrastructure and domain scientists. It will also support the integration
of the Ensemble Toolkit with a range of science applications, as well as its
use in solving scientific problems of significant societal impact that are
currently unable to utilize the collective capacity of supercomputers, campus
clusters and clouds.
