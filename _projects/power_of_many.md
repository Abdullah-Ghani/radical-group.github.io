This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of cyber-infrastructure
and domain scientists to develop the [RADICAL Ensemble Toolkit
(EnTK)](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.entk). EnTK enhances the
ability of scientists to effectively and efficiently study natural hazards and
renewable energy. The use of EnTK on high performance computing resources
B
supports novel “ensemble-based” methods at scales not currently possible.
