This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of cyber-infrastructure and domain scientists to develop the [RADICAL Ensemble Toolkit (EnTK)](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.entk). EnTK enhances the ability of scientists to effectively and efficiently study natural hazards and renewable energy. The use of EnTK on high performance computing resources supports novel “ensemble-based” methods at scales not currently possible.
