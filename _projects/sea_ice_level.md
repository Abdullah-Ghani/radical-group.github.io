Our goal is to develop a flexible computational framework for producing sea-level rise projections that is accessible to a diverse set of users and scalable to a wide range of computing platforms.  Current methods for producing sea-level rise projections share the same core processes (i.e., ice sheet contributions, glaciers, thermal expansion, etc.); yet, each approach is uniquely different in the structure and assumptions made about these core processes. We develop a software framework to explore scientific hypotheses pertaining to future sea-level change, reducing the amount of time and effort needed from the scientists and the amount of required computing resources.
