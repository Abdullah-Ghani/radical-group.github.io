### Bio

Shantenu is an Associate Professor at Rutgers University. He was appointed a Rutgers Chancellor’s Scholar in 2015. Before moving to Rutgers, he led Cyberinfrastructure Research and Development at the CCT at Louisiana State University; he was also a member of the Graduate Faculty in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh (UK), and a Visiting Scientist at University College London.

His research interests lie at the triple point of Computing, Computational Science and Cyberinfrastructure.  Shantenu is the PI of  RADICAL and the lead investigator of RADICAL-Cybertools (including SAGA http://www.saga-project.org), which is a community standard and is part of the official middleware/software stack of most major Production Distributed Cyberinfrastructure — such as US NSF’s XSEDE and the European Grid Infrastructure. He hopes to play a part in the upcoming revolution at the interface of computing and health-science — global health and “personalized” medicine.

Shantenu is a recipient of a NSF CAREER award and has won several prestigious awards at ACM/IEEE Supercomputing and the International Supercomputing Series. He was awarded a Rutgers Board of Trustees Fellowship for Scholarly Excellence.  His current research has been funded by multiple NSF awards and US Department of Energy (DoE); his work has also been funded by US National Institute for Health (NIH), and the UK EPSRC (OMII-UK project and Research theme at the e-Science Institute).

Jha seeks fearless and revolutionary young minds to join the RADICAL (thinking) group! Away from work, he tries middle-distance running and biking, tends to be an economics-junky, enjoys reading and writing random musings and tries to use his copious amounts of free time with a conscience.
