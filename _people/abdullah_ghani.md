I am an undergraduate student majoring in Applied Sciences in Engineering and Computer Science at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. My main focus of study include High Performance Computing, ML and AI.

I work closely with ameliorating and maintaining infrastructure at Radical Labs. 

My ultimate goal is to positively impact society and help others through advancing the landscape of technology with engineering.
