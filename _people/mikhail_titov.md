Mikhail is a Research Associate at the Rutgers University. He pursued his Ph.D. 
degree in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington in 2016, 
under the supervision of Dr. Gergely ZÃ¡ruba and Dr. Kaushik De. His doctoral 
research was focused on applying data mining and machine learning techniques 
and methods to the workload management system PanDA (the Production and 
Distributed Analysis system) to investigate correlations and similarities 
between data objects (involved entities, e.g., inter-user, user-data 
relationships) for efficient data distribution and data caching strategies. 
In 2007, he received his Combined B.S./M.S. degree in Computer Engineering 
(Computing and Information Science) at the Moscow Engineering and Physics 
Institute (NRNU "MEPhI", Moscow, Russia). Since 2008, he is an Associated member 
of the personnel (Scientist) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research 
(CERN, Geneva, Switzerland).

Research interest is data analysis with a focus on analysis of metadata gathered 
from distributed processing systems. This process of data analytics 
(descriptive and predictive) is to reveal and explore implicit relationships 
and inter-dependencies between data records and analysis entities. That is the 
core which interests are built around, and which include research areas such as 
grid computing, cloud computing, high performance computing, data mining, 
machine learning, modeling and simulation.

Mikhail has joined the RADICAL group in February 2020.
