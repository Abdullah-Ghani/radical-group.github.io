I am a fifth year PhD student at Rutgers University and a member at RADICAL
Lab.

Before my PhD studies, I acquired an engineering diploma (5-year studies) in
[Computer Engineering and Informatics](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en), and a
Master of Science in Integrated Hardware and Software Systems. I also worked
for three and a half years as an IC Design Engineer at Analogies SA, an IP
Semiconductor Company in Greece.

My research focuses on providing data-intensive capabilities on HPC for
analyzing data from Scientific simulations, through abstraction, architectures
and middleware. My research interests include High Performance Computing, Task
Parallel Applications and Architectures, Distributed System Communication
Protocols, and Distributed Data Abstractions.

Currently, I am involved in two projects, [MIddleware for Data-Intensive
Analytics and Science (MIDAS)](/projects/midas) and [Imagery
Cyberinfrastructure and Extensible Building-Blocks to Enhance Research in the
Geosciences (ICEBERG)](/projects/iceberg). In addition, I regularly
contribute to several [RADICAL-Cybertools
projects](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/).
