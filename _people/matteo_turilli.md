### Bio

Matteo is an Assistant Research Professor at Rutgers University. Before moving
to Rutgers, he was the Chair of the EGI-InSPIRE Task on Federation of Clouds
and Senior Research Associate at the Oxford e-Research Centre, University of
Oxford, UK.

Matteo's research interests span several domains, including Distributed
Computing, Formal Methods, and Computer Ethics. Currently, his research
focuses on design and development of Cyberinfrastructures, including
federation and selection of resources, and strategies for the execution of
domain-specific scientific workflows.

Matteo is the co-PI of the [http://radical.rutgers.edu/](Research in Advanced
Distributed Cyberinfrastructure and Applications Laboratory (RADICAL)) and an
investigator of the <a
href="https://github.com/radical-cybertools">RADICAL-Cybertools</a>. In this
capacity, he led the design and development of <a
href="https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.analytics">RADICAL-Analytics</a>,
contributed to design <a
href="https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot">RADICAL-Pilot</a>,
and supervised the design and development of the <a
href="https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.entk">Ensemble Toolkit
(EnTK)</a>.

Matteo is Senior Scientist for several projects funded by multiple NSF and US
Department of Energy (DoE) awards. In this capacity, he contributes to support
the research of diverse scientific domains, including earth and climate
science, molecular dynamics, and a wide range of physics.

Matteo supervises both Masters and PhD students, managing the day-to-day
operations of RADICAL and of its software development projects. He welcomes
applications from exceptionally driven, national and international students,
willing to contribute to the field of Distributed Computing both with software
development and foundational research.

Away from work, Matteo enjoys cooking, photography and many outdoor activities
including running, hiking and climbing.
