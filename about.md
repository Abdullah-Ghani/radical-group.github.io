### About us
*The Research in Advanced Distributed Cyberinfrastructure and Applications Laboratory*
(RADICAL) works at the triple point of Computing, Computation & Data-enabled Science 
and Cyberinfrastructure Research & Development. See our Projects Pages for some 
exciting examples of the projects we are working on.

### Research
The development of high-performance and distributed cyberinfrastructure – tools, 
middleware and frameworks – to support computational science has historically 
been characterized by local and point solutions; tools are often unsustainable 
whilst many solutions are redundant. This state-of-practice points to missing 
abstractions, design principles and systems engineering concepts for high-performance 
distributed cyberinfrastructure. The RADICAL (Research in Advanced Distributed 
Cyberinfrastructure and Applications Laboratory) team addresses these shortcomings 
by contributing to the science-of-cyberinfrastructure. A science-of-cyberinfrastructure 
provides a pathway to translate theoretical advances and conceptual abstractions 
into cyberinfrastructure developed as an engineered system which provides the 
required balance of functionality, performance and usability.

### Software Development
We develop *RADICAL-SAGA* (in python) and *SAGA-based Pilot-Job (RADICAL-Pilot/BigJob)* 
amongst other RADICAL Cybertools — a repertoire of  tools and capabilities that 
enable the scalable, extensible and interoperable utilization of regional, 
national and international production distributed cyberinfrastructure.  RADICAL 
members lead the SAGA project – a global distributed computing standard, used 
by many applications, tool-developers and production distributed computing 
infrastructures.
